## Description:
    
This app is an app to track each exercise you do for a day and compiles your daily workout as a whole, and injects that data into a database. The user can see their last 7 workouts as well as some graphs to breakdown which exercises and how much weight you lifted and time spent doing said exercise. In order we have screenshots of the simple navigation bar with an option for home page and the workout dashboard. Next is the home page that displays the most recent workout. Once the new exercise option is clicked, the new exercise page will appear. once your workouts have been updated the dashboard shown last will pop up, filling with your data.
